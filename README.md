<H3><b>A comparative Exploration of DALL-E-2 and Stable-Diffusion-2 based on the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS)</b></H3>

<h5>DALL-E-2</h5><br>
DALL-E 2 is an image generation system created by OpenAI which can
generate high-resolution images that combine various concepts and art styles.
The project was built in PyTorch using ViT-H/16 text encounters with the
training data of 650M images scraped from the internet and aligned by
CLIP


<h5>Stable-Diffusion-2</h5><br>
The Stable Diffusion 2.0 release includes robust text-to-image models trained using a brand new text encoder (OpenCLIP), developed by LAION with support from Stability AI, which greatly improves the quality of the generated images compared to earlier V1 releases. The text-to-image models in this release can generate images with default resolutions of both 512x512 pixels and 768x768 pixels. These models are trained on an aesthetic subset of the LAION-5B dataset created by the DeepFloyd team at Stability AI, which is then further filtered to remove adult content using LAIONâ€™s NSFW filter.
